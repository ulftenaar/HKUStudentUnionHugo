<h1>Calendar</h1>
<p>On the HKU there are a LOT of different student initiatives, and as chaotic art students it is hard to keep track of all of them. This calendar is meant for activities of the Union but also of other events organised by (or for) HKU students or teachers.
Did we miss an event? Please mail us at <a href="mailto:calendar@hkustudentunion.com">calendar@hkustudentunion.com</a> with the location, date, time, picture and a description.</p>
<p><strong>Important:</strong> Are you joining an action/demonstration/strike or any other form of activistic activity? Make sure you read our <a href="/about#action-consensus">action consensus.</a></p>

As the genocide in Palestine is escalating to a new stage, it is our duty to stop our compliance and escalate for Palestine!</p>
<p>So whether you&rsquo;ve never been to a demo, or u want to take it a bit further and learn some more. Come learn with us about direct action, what your rights are en what to do in case of arrest. This is a very useful training if you want to protest whilst enforcing a bit more pressure, but as police repression is growing it can also be handy for if you go to regular demonstrations.</p>

        <details><summary>26 May 2025, Sit-in &amp; demo for Palestine &amp; Potluck, Oudenoord, 12:00-18:00</summary><p><figure class="calpic"><img src="/img/calendar/sitin26mei.jpg" width="300px">
</figure>

Coming Monday the 26th of May, HKU4Palestine will organise a sit-in in the Atrium of Oudenoord. We do this to urge the CVB (College Van Bestuur) to finally meet our demands, listed below. Despite our numerous attempts to convince the CVB of the importance of these demands, after more than a year, the CVB has been incapable of meeting these demands and breaking ties with Israel. Therefore, we will inform the CVB that our demands have not changed.</p>
<p>Please join our sit-in, attend our workshops and join forces. HKU students and staff, let’s finally mobilize!</p>
<h5 id="our-demands">Our demands:</h5>
<p>The HKU must write a statement that clearly rejects the genocide, disproportionate violence, and impending ethnic cleansing committed by Israel
The HKU must sever ties with Bezalel Academy of Arts and Design
The HKU must investigate any connections with Israeli institutions, companies and investors, making these public, and severing these ties</p>
<h5 id="program">Program:</h5>
<p>Start @ 12:00 atrium Oudenoord Activitities
12:00-16:20 will include: making banners/patches/buttons, teach-ins, speeches and chanting.
@ 16:20: marching to Nieuwekade
@ 17:00: chanting at nieuwekade and delivering written demands to the CvB
@ 18:00: potluck Student Union @ Paardenveld</p>
<p>Please bring some materials to make stuff for the protesting or for your own patches etc. think about fabric, cardboard and markers. Also please bring instruments so we can make some noise! (or nice music occasionally).</p>
<p>The sit in will be inspired by the character of the UU encampment - so we can connect, learn and make a statement! If you can also bring food for the HKU Student Union’s potluck in the evening!</p>
<h5 id="potluck">Potluck</h5>
<p>Even Ants need to rest after an action. So the Union is organising a Potluck at Paardenveld on May 26st, right after the demonstration at Nieuwekade. Bring yourself, your friends, your enthousiasm and if you can a vegan meal/snack. Lets take some time to unwind after a full day and meet some of your fellow friends from the ant hill.</p>
