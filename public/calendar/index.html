<h1>Calendar</h1>
<p>On the HKU there are a LOT of different student initiatives, and as chaotic art students it is hard to keep track of all of them. This calendar is meant for activities of the Union but also of other events organised by (or for) HKU students or teachers.
Did we miss an event? Please mail us at <a href="mailto:calendar@hkustudentunion.com">calendar@hkustudentunion.com</a> with the location, date, time, picture and a description.</p>
<p><strong>Important:</strong> Are you joining an action/demonstration/strike or any other form of activistic activity? Make sure you read our <a href="/about#action-consensus">action consensus.</a></p>

As the genocide in Palestine is escalating to a new stage, it is our duty to stop our compliance and escalate for Palestine!</p>
<p>So whether you&rsquo;ve never been to a demo, or u want to take it a bit further and learn some more. Come learn with us about direct action, what your rights are en what to do in case of arrest. This is a very useful training if you want to protest whilst enforcing a bit more pressure, but as police repression is growing it can also be handy for if you go to regular demonstrations.</p>

We will be in the HKU Nieuwekade entrance hall from 10:30 making a quilt that we will be able to use as a banner for other protests. No experience needed! So bring your friends, your favorite art supplies such as paints, embroidery or knitting supplies and come quilt with us!</p>

<details><summary>June 17, Nieuwekade, 16:00 - 18:00, Workshop Session</summary><p>Because so many students and teachers still don&rsquo;t feel heard by the Organisation of the HKU, we organise a session at Nieuwekade. We will together write our thoughts and worries about abolished workshop policy. We invited the CvB to come and pick up this book, and have a chat with their students.</p>
