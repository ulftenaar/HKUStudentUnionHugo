<p>Dear Ant, Member of the HKU Student Union. Welcome to another year, we hope you had an amazing holiday and had some time to unwind, and maybe even had some fun. We definitely did, and we are starting the ant hill up again.</p>
<p>This third edition of the Newsletter is just to inform you of some things that are important and fun to know, we will send another bigger newsletter VERY soon!</p>
<p>We had a meeting last Friday to already discuss some of our goals for the next year. Some of our new goals are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Getting the school off Microsoft</li>
<li>Solidifying the union (with Vidius) so that the Union can live on after current members graduate</li>
<li>Getting finances in order</li>
<li>Getting recognized within the HKU as the official Union, while remaining fully independent</li>
</ul>
<p>and also very important: we want to grow the Union a lot more. To do that we have a plan for a ‘big rollout’, where we release posters, stickers, a new zine, a newsletter, and maybe an instagram page all at the same time. For that we need some more people to help! So if you want to help us with any of that, please reach out to us via electronic mail. We can use all the help we can get &lt;3<br>
We will then also start promoting a bannermaking event, where we will together make a big student union banner. It will be sick. Date to be announced, but keep an eye on our <a href="https://hkustudentunion.nl/calendar/">calendar</a></p>
<p>One last thing: we have a general meeting again thursday 18 september at 16:30 in the Oudenoord atrium. We will once again go over all our goals for the next year, and try go get started with everything needed for the big rollout.<br>
This meeting, like all our meetings, is open for everyone to join! So please come by and tell what you want to fight for in the upcoming school year.</p>
<p>See you soon,</p>
<p>The Ants of the Union</p>
