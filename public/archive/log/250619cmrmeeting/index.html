<h1>Attended CMR meeting June 19</h1>

 
<time datetime="2025-06-20T10:37:06&#43;02:00">June 20, 2025</time>

<p>Because the CvB always speaks very highly of their CMR, we also wanted to see what a meeting looks like. These meetings are open for visitors, they cannot take part in the meeting, but they are wlcome to spectate as a fly on the wall. So that&rsquo;s what three of our members did. We recieved a warm welcome by the members of the CMR, with some of them we had already spoke beforehand. The CMR consists of 20-something people, about half om them are teachers, and the other half are students. There is one from every school, or &lsquo;acedemias&rsquo; as they now call them. They sit in a rather big room around this huge table.<br>
In this particular meeting the CvB joined, this happens about once a month, the CvB and CMR then exchange updates and the CMR has some time to ask questions to the CvB.<br>
The CvB started the meeting, talking about recent events and talking briefly about the occupation of HKU4Palestine a week earier. They also talked about the book of the Union that was handed to the CvB two days prior. These were very small announcements, there was not a lot of information given. Both HKU4Palestine and the Student Union seem to be well known under the CvB and the CMR, as our names were mentioned and everyone knew exactly who they were talking about.
Next the conversation was about flags, as they talked about the code of conduct for staff. Apparently it is not allowed to hang national flags around the school, not even dutdh flags are allowed. For artworks it is different, then it would have to be discussed with the concierges</p>
