<h1>Interview Alumnus about the Workshops</h1>

 
<time datetime="2025-06-22T18:34:47&#43;02:00">June 22, 2025</time>

<p>The abolishment of the old alumni ruling was a shock to all of us. We have been working hard since April to try to nullify the change and revert the rule back to it&rsquo;s old state.<br>
To demonstrate how important the rule is, we held an interview with an alumnus of HKU photography. You can read a summary of the interview here.</p>
<h3 id="when-did-you-hear-about-the-workshop-policy-for-alumni">When did you hear about the workshop policy for alumni?</h3>
<h3 id="how-did-you-use-the-workshops-as-an-alumnus">How did you use the workshops as an alumnus?</h3>
<p>&ldquo;I mainly used the photo studio and the printing workshop. I mainly used my time in the workshops to make some pieces for my portfolio. I also took the time to practice as a photographer, and the employees of the workshops were extremely supportive. I also used the blackbox to be able to work on different projects that really helped me in my development as a professional.  &quot;</p>
<h3 id="what-would-happen-if-you-were-in-the-shoes-of-the-students-now">What would happen if you were in the shoes of the students now?</h3>
<p>&ldquo;I would panic, because i would know that it would be nearly impossible to do what I wanted to do.&rdquo;</p>
