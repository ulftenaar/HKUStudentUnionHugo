      <description>&lt;p&gt;On the 17th of June the Union hosted a session to write a book full of worries about the workshops. There were students and one alumnus that wanted to make their voices heard. After about an hour of writing and decorating the book, Judith of the CvB and Esther (Representative of the CvB) came to recieve the book personally, and we had a small conversation. On june 24 there was another conversation with representatives of the Union, that went a big deeper.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
