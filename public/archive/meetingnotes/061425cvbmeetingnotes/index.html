  <div class="main"><h3 id="action-tuesday">Action Tuesday</h3>
<p>Is it still even worth our time to spread news about the action? there will probably be like 10 people, we can also frame it like a conversation. But we can use the Cvb not wanting to talk to the group again as leverage, so the action can still do something. But there are a lot of deadlines.There should be like 10 people to make it credible. We should ask in the groups how many people are going to show up, we can also use the whatsapp groupchat. No need to send it through all the whatsapp groups. we can try to send the form anyway.</p>
<p><em>Who is going to the meeting</em>
Robin roos pier are going to a meeting about the room on 24th, so it would be best if other people can go. Doubble check with Luka, anke?</p>
