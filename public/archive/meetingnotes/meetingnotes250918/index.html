<h2 id="25-09-18-meeting-vidius-x-hku-su">25-09-18 Meeting (VIDIUS x HKU SU)</h2>
<p><strong>VIDIUS: Sofie, Stefan - HKU Student Union (HKU SU): Francisco, Robbie, Pier, Sylwia, Rozemond</strong></p>
<p>-Introduction of VIDIUS to members to those who haven’t met them</p>
<p>--Organize vote? Have all people affiliated with HKU SU been given ample opportunity to vote about collaboration with VIDIUS? Everyone present at this meeting agrees with the collaboration with VIDIUS</p>
<p>-Explanation of collaboration between VIDIUS and HKU SU, if HKU students become members of VIDIUS, the money they pay goes directly to HKU SU. Let VIDIUS know if we (HKU SU) need any money, they will be able to help with this</p>
<p>-On the 26th of September VIDIUS meets with CvB of HKU, let them know if they need to bring up anything (focus will be institution racism, pointed them towards HKU SU website article)</p>
<p><strong>Discussion of list of goals for the union on 25-09-12:</strong></p>
<p>-Sofie sends us correspondence with HKU about period products, figure this out per location/school etc. VIDIUS is campaigning for free period products in Hogescholen and Universities, at HKU this differs greatly between different locations. See VIDIUS’ instagram: <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DOOB7LDDLwY/?hl=cs">https://www.instagram.com/p/DOOB7LDDLwY/?hl=cs</a></p>
<p>-Get rid of Microsoft, talk to Sen about posters he put up</p>
<p>-Ask people AVM about leaving teacher, visible minorities should be included in the union in general (poster/post design). Growing the union will (hopefully) lead to more diverse voices, this is absolutely essential.</p>
<p>-Link to VIDIUS on out website, VIDIUS link to us on their website</p>
<p>-We still need a representative Janskerkhof, Loods, Jaarbeursplein. Add other location representatives to website.</p>
<p>-Know very few people at Janskerkhof? Make posters, target them specifically. Talk of issues there that would concern us as a union.</p>
<p>-Instagram, work together with HKU for Palestine?</p>
<p>-Posters for content creator, Francisco does the memes!</p>
<p>-Pier and Sylwia will make posters together</p>
<p>-Get HKU to get rid of Coca Cola, bring back mug place at Oudenoord</p>
<p><strong>-Grievances of students (like the physical ‘box of grievances’ we used to have but digital, send link + and put link on poster that leads to online box , add list of the grievances on website (if the people agrees ton this. Organize them by location, or school/course.</strong></p>
<p>-Sylwia uses HKU SU in letter about a problem with a thesis supervisor. (Summary of the problem: one of the 4th year Fine Arts tutors for their thesis only speaks English. This means that Dutch speaking students will need to write it in English when they might not speak English fluently, or are not comfortable. HKU suggests that they should translate via AI, or Google Translate. This is ridiculous. It is a problem for approximately 4 students and should be easily fixable by the Fine Arts department. Normally you are unable to switch tutor, but obviously an exception should be made. Check if there a legal requirement for students at a Dutch school to be able the write their thesis in Dutch.)</p>
<p><strong>-Plan banner making day!</strong></p>
