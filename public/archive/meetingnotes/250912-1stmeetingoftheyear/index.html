  <div class="main"><h2 id="tldr">TLDR:</h2>
<p><strong>Vidius:</strong></p>
<p>A big portion of the talk was about the meeting Roos, Pier, and Fransisco had with vidius on 11 september 2025. The Union is now an official action group of VIDIUS. This means we can use their network to our advantage (and vice versa), and we will be able to recieve some money from them.</p>
<p>Very soon they will have a talk with the CvB, about some of our points, like microsoft, institutional racism etc.</p>
<p><strong>Goals</strong></p>
<p>We spent some time to set new goals for the year, you can find them below, on the meeting on thursday 18th, this will also be discussed again.<br>
One of our biggest goals is to get the school of of microsoft. We are aware that there are multiple parties working on this currently, teachers, HKU4Palestine, and probably many more. We will try to contact them all to maybe organise a big action together.</p>
<p><strong>Growing the union</strong></p>
<p>We talked a lot about how to grow the union, which is one of our main goals this year<br>
We will try to release multiple things at the same time in about two weeks, so that people will definetly see at least one of them: A new zine, posters around the school, stickers, a new newsletter, updated website, and we are considering to make an instagram.<br>
We will be working towards a banner making event after the big rollout. This will be pushed everywhere.</p>
<p>We have another meeting thursday 18 september, please come by, we will set our goals again so this is a good way to make your voice heard.</p>
<p>Points:</p>
<ul>
<li>Vidius</li>
<li>Docs</li>
<li>Goal[48;66;269;1122;1883ts and Ambitions</li>
<li>Talks with the CvB about becoming the official ‚Äúunion‚Äù</li>
<li>HKU4palestine</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="vidius"><strong>Vidius</strong></h2>
<p>Pier, Rozemond, Francisco went to vidius on 11 sep to talk with the new board. About mostly money thigns and what our plans are.</p>
<p>If one of our members is in the board of Vidius, then they apply for a grant from the HKU. Its still a bit unsure. There looking for someone for treasure. So not as much symbolic.</p>
<p>The Union will form as an action group of VIDIUS and they will be able to give us money.</p>
<p>They want people to join vidius obviously, so they will give the membership money to us!!! If someone joins Vidius they pay 12,50 a year, and they will pay us this 12,50 per member that joins. Along that, we will get a lump sum of money, 300 euros per year was discussed. After a year the amount of money will be revisited.</p>
<p>Roos, pier and fransisco will be the ‚Äòboard‚Äô of the Union and will go to vidius to explain what we‚Äôve done with the money.</p>
<p>You don‚Äôt need to be a member of vidius to join, but its a nice way to support the union.</p>
<p><strong><em>We need to have solid goals</em></strong> about what we want to do for the future.</p>
<p>Vidius can archive our stuff, so if the union dies they can keep it until different groups of people are ready to set it up.</p>
<p>Vidius will talk with the CvB: topics: Fuck microsoft, communication, HKU4palestine. They will we bringing up our concerns. This really helps our cause. They have a big name and are another party to pressure the CvB.</p>
<p><strong>They asked us to find out the situation with free period products in the HKU.</strong> We should ask around and report back.</p>
<p>They asked what we want to do in the upcoming year, and they discussed the goals.</p>
<p>Around the first monday of the month their will be a meeting with them, also one of their members is joining us next week thursday.</p>
<p>If the HKU doesnt publically release a statement, then Vidius will contact and make a press statement.</p>
<p>Vidius was pro instagram. Because nobody vists. the website</p>
