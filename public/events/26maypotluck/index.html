<h1>Sit-In &amp; Potluck for Palestine</h1>

 
<time datetime="2025-06-03T15:17:16&#43;02:00">June 3, 2025</time>

<p>On May 26 HKU4Palestine and the Union organised an action to urge our CvB again to break ties with the Bezalel University. It started as a sit-in in the atrium of HKU location Oudenoord. There were a lot of different activities like making buttons and patches, lectures and a teach-in from Politics in the classroom. For four hours a part of the HKU was a liberated zone.<br>
At 16:30 the people started walking to HKU location Nieuwekade, to hand the demands of HKU4Palestine to the CvB. When they arrived the door of the building had been locked, because they feared an encampment. This was unexpected an unnecessary, there were no plans to occupy the building. After just a couple minutes of chanting, a spokesperson of the CvB came out using the door on the side. The spokesperson said the door was locked out of safety precautions. They allowed a couple of people to enter to hand the demands to the CvB.</p>
<p>They were inside for about 15 minutes. Talking about the situation and the demands. They were met with the exact same empty words like last year. Nothing led of the talk, so they agreed to have a meeting a week later.</p>
<p>While they were inside chatting, the demonstrators were chanting outside.</p>
<p>There was a potluck afterwards in the park right next to Nieuwekade. There was a lot of food brought and quite a lot of people came.</p>
