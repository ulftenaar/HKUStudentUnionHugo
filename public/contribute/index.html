<p>Dear ant,</p>
<p>Welcome. You have made it to the end of the internet. I spend a long time building this website again from the ground up. Our old website looks similar, but is built completely different. That side was just plain old html and css. This was good in the beginning, it didnt take long to set up and it was nice to sketch out ideas.<br>
However, now that time has past I found that updating the site constantly wouldn&rsquo;t be possible in the future. So i started again. This time using <a href="https://gohugo.com">HUGO</a> as a framework of our website.</p>
<h3 id="-what">### What?</h3>
<p>Hugo is an open source and free website builder. It turns Markdown files into Html files. It works perfectly with managing big sites like ours that have a lot of pages and subpages.</p>
