### Do Something | HKU Student Union

Every policy decision about the HKU is made by the unelected board of directors. This makes the HKU a very undemocratic institution. The only prominent form of student representation is that of class representatives, whose advice to the board is non-binding, and whose role is in facilitating isolated communication between individual students and faculty directors.

The HKU student union opposes the undemocratic nature of the HKU and aims to facilitate the coming together of critical students across all HKU schools. It is a loose association meant to provide the connecting tissue between otherwise isolated students, so we can speak up and influence the policies that affect our community as a unified voice. By providing channels of communication, we can facilitate meetings to organise protests, mass complains or negotiations with the board. Furthermore, we aim to publish zines, statements, posters, etc. communicating our goals and ideas.

### Structure of the Union

The HKU Student Union is organised as a flat structure. No one has any power over anyone else, and decisions are made by consensus. Anyone is welcome to participate in organising the union and related workgroups or write articles for the zine and other platforms we may establish. If you’d like to do anything on behalf of the union, please do present your ideas at a meeting, send us an email or message us in the signal chat. If this way of organising becomes unsustainable or impractical, we may review it and establish a more formal way of organising the union.

##### What does it mean to be a member?

As a member of the union you can either take on an organisational role or a following role In following, your voice can empower us in a protest or a petition, and you become a valuable part of our network. This will take little time and energy. All you need to do is join the whatsapp community, follow our newsletter and/or sign up for the union (for which you can find the link on the back of this zine). Input about things happening at your school or helping us build our network through your contacts is helpful.
In organising, you can organise – pretty straight forward. You can either join already existing workgroups or use our network to set up a new group with a new goal. We strive to realise both smaller and bigger goals. You can do this by signing up and joining a work group / organisation chat (signal).

you are not obliged to do anything when you sign up - it’s more of a network through which we can reach you. for now also one of the big focusses is on the workshops. but also a network for future power to the students (to make all the work we put into uniting into a sustainable way to raise our voice and to continue beyond this one thing)
