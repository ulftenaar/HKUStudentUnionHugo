As much as you want it to be! **You are never obliged to take part in anything**, members can give as much time and energy as they want/can.

As a member of the union you can either take on an organisational role or a following role.

In following, your voice can empower us in a protest or a petition, and you become a valuable part of our network. You can take part in protests or other actions and help us by spreading the word about the union.

In organising, you can help the union by joining already existing workgroups or use our network to set up a new group with a new goal. You can join meetings, write articles, organise events, design, there is a place for everyone, no matter how much you can give.

*Not being active for a while is completely fine, and also healthy.*
