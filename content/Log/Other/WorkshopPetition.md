The Union started a petition about the abolishement of the policy for alumni, to gather everyone's voices and worries. We also wanted to show just how many people were aware of this rule. Currently it has been signed by 326 people. You can still sign it, click [here](doedna).  
This was important because there is no written proof anywhere about this rule, yet X amount of people counted on it.
