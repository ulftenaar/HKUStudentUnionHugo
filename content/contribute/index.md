Dear ant, 

Welcome. You have made it to the end of the internet. I spent a long time building this website again from the ground up. Our old website looks similar, but is built completely different. That side was just plain old html and css. This was perfect in the beginning, it didnt take long to set up and it was nice to sketch out ideas.  
However, now that time has past I found that updating the site constantly wouldn't be possible in the future. So i started again. This time using [HUGO](https://gohugo.io) as a framework of our website.

### ### What?

Hugo is an open source and free website builder. It turns Markdown files into Html files. It works perfectly with managing big sites like ours that have a lot of pages and subpages.  

### ### What??

Whatever. Important thing is that this site is **very easy to update and maintain**. You can basically write stuff like you would in any other text editor and it will appear here! without struggling with good old HTML.
This means that also **YOU** can now write new stuff for our website, awesome right. So that hopefully when i get ran over by a hamster in a monster truck this site won't cease to exist. 

### ### So how can i contribute? 

Like mentioned, these pages are created with Markdown (MD), (here)[https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/] you can find a basic tutorial. 

Add 1-6 #'s before a line to make it a heading. Asterisks (*) are used for bold and for cursive texts. EASY! 
So you can just write your markdown file, give it a title and write a short summary for on the website, mail it to us, website@hkustudentunion.com and we'll add it in! EASY! 
Better yet: fork our github repo and do it yourself! but this requires more knowledge heh.

### ### How can I write MD? 

Couple of options, in most editors like word it is not an option to export it to MD. you can do it via a browser, websites like [stack-edit](https://stackedit.io/), let you do it for free. and is probably the easiest option. Also open source, but with google integration. [mark](https://mark.barelyhuman.dev/) also works, but doesn't save your files in the browser. BUT NO GOOGLE

### ### Conclusion, this is sick right. 

Yes it is, please shoot a message for any things that should be changed, and have fun writing.
