On the HKU there are a LOT of different student initiatives, and as chaotic art students it is hard to keep track of all of them. This calendar is meant for activities of the Union but also of other events organised by (or for) HKU students or teachers.
Did we miss an event? Please mail us at [calendar@hkustudentunion.com](mailto:calendar@hkustudentunion.com) with the location, date, time, picture and a description.

**Important:** Are you joining an action/demonstration/strike or any other form of activistic activity? Make sure you read our [action consensus.](/about#action-consensus)
