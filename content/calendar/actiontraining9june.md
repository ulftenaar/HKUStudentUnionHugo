As the genocide in Palestine is escalating to a new stage, it is our duty to stop our compliance and escalate for Palestine! 

So whether you've never been to a demo, or u want to take it a bit further and learn some more. Come learn with us about direct action, what your rights are en what to do in case of arrest. This is a very useful training if you want to protest whilst enforcing a bit more pressure, but as police repression is growing it can also be handy for if you go to regular demonstrations.
