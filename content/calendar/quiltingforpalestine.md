News from HKU4Palestine, a sister organisation of the Union:

On June 12 we will have a communal quilt session with HKU4Palestine so feel free to come at any time of day! We will be in the HKU Nieuwekade entrance hall from 10:30 making a quilt that we will be able to use as a banner for other protests. No experience needed! So bring your friends, your favorite art supplies such as paints, embroidery or knitting supplies and come quilt with us!

When: June 12 from 10:30 - end of day Where: Nieuwekade 1 entrance hall

Note that this will be a quilt session in the form of a (low-risk) demonstration, so if you feel comfortable covering your face since there will likely be cameras inside please do so!

THREAD NEEDLES, CUT TIES!
