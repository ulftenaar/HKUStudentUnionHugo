The people of the Union try to meet once a week to talk about recent activities and also discuss things that we stil want to do. These meetings are at 16:30, at the Atrium of Oudenoord. Anyone is welcome to join, and everyones opinions are weighed equally. We are a flat organisation, so even if you come for the first time your opinion is valued. We take notes at these meetings that we publish here.
