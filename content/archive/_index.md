## Welcome

This is the HKU Student Union's "Archive" page, for the lack of a better name.  
On this website you can find a lot of different types of information and documents. We value transparency at the Union, so we will try to publish as much info as we can.

To navigate this page you can use the heading above to go to different sub-pages of this website. You can also click on a a tag to view all posts with a specific topic. Click on the "tags" title itself to view a list of all the available tags.  
The activity log has also been split up into different categories to keep that section a bit more organised.

If you are ever lost on the website, or want to go back one layer, you can look to the bottom right and find a lovely list of where you currently are.

There is a lot to explore! Everything in red is clickable. So get a good cup of tea and enjoy!
