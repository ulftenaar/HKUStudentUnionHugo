After about two months of email correspondence we were invited to a meeting with the CvB. This was originally planned to be about the Union itself and what the position would be in the HKU. We also planned later to discuss the workshops. 

The attendees of the meeting were Pier, Tom, Rozemond and Robin for the Union. The HKU was represented by Judith, and Heleen of the CvB, Esther (spokesperson of the CvB), and Joris (director of the workshops).  
We agreed to talk about the Union in the first half hour and then talk about the Workshops for the remaining time. Heleen had to leave after the first half hour, and then Joris took her place.

We were unfortunately not allowed to record the meeting, so this post is based on our own notes, and the notes we recieved from Esther. We will start with giving a summary of the workshops and then about the Union.

### Workshops 
We started the conversation with asking about the book of worries, that we handed over last week. Judith and Joris had read parts, and Esther had read everything. Judith said that the consequences of the change, and the worries of the students are now more than clear.

Then Joris gave us an overview about how this rule came into effect. The school had been working on changing the alumni policy for a few years. They promoted the workshops a lot more for the students, but then started noticing the workshops were too full,
