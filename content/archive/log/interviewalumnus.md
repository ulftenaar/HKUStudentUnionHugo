The abolishment of the old alumni ruling was a shock to all of us. We have been working hard since April to try to nullify the change and revert the rule back to it's old state.  
To demonstrate how important the rule is, we held an interview with an alumnus of HKU photography. You can read a summary of the interview here. 

### When did you hear about the workshop policy for alumni?

### How did you use the workshops as an alumnus? 
"I mainly used the photo studio and the printing workshop. I mainly used my time in the workshops to make some pieces for my portfolio. I also took the time to practice as a photographer, and the employees of the workshops were extremely supportive. I also used the blackbox to be able to work on different projects that really helped me in my development as a professional.  "

### What would happen if you were in the shoes of the students now?
"I would panic, because i would know that it would be nearly impossible to do what I wanted to do."
