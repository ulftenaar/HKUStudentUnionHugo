On June 17th, we hosted a session in Nieuwekade, where we invited people to come write thoughts about the workshops in a book, that we would later hand over to the CvB. There were a couple students and also an alumnus. We also added answers from our petition, with more than 350 answers. The session itself was nice, it was good to be able to connect with students who are in the same boat and also wanted to share some thoughts. In the end we made a book full of messages to the CvB.  
After about an hour, Judith from the CvB came to recieve the book. We tried to engage in a conversation, by sharing the reason behind the session, and the story of an alumnus that wouldn't have been where they are now without the old workshop policy.
The conversation itself was rather short, it was clear that Judith did not want to say anything, delaying the conversation to Tuesday June 24th, when the Union had a planned meeting. This was dissapointing, some students were hoping to get some answers to questions they had.
In the end, we also asked if they could send us the link to the 'government ruling' they keep mentioning every time. We already asked for a link to this document in our first email on April 11th, but we still haven't recieved it. Judith said that they would have to look into that, and mentioned that it is the ruling about 'publieke middelen voor privaat gebruik'. To remind them to send over this link, we sent them an email a day after the session. We recieved these documents two days later.
There was a conversation with the CvB on June 24, you can read more [here](/archive/log/250624conversationCvB)
